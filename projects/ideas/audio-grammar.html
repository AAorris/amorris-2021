<body>
    Can we define a grammer that matches patterns in audio instead of text?

    Ex. We select text with fragment expressions like [a-z]+

    Audio could be described as a triple of (time, frequency, amplitude)

    We could match on expressions like ([0-1],[0-1],[0.8-1.0])
    time: 0-1 (beginning/end)
    frequency: 0-1 (lowest/highest)
    amplitude: 0.8-1 (upper range of volume)

    loud = (ALL,ALL,HIGH)
    ALL : [0-1]
    HIGH : [0.8-1]
