    <h1>Project Gravity</h1>
    <p>
      Gravity is an attractive force that gently
      pulls matters together over long distances.

      Project gravity is about creating a social
      network that brings people together.

      The design is pull based and universal.
      You post content that matters to you, and
      your friends can subscribe to pull in
      updates to stay in touch.

      I believe in a future where everyone can
      have their own web site. That social networks,
      emails, phone numbers, can all be replaced
      with an online url to your home page.

    <h3>Various technical thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      - you own what is basically a web scraper
      - you can process it locally in the browser
      - you can pay for cloud compute scraping
      - your posts are simply publishing html pages
      - scrapers must be able to discover your posts
        via a domain root (ex. nerd.amorris.ca)
      - links should be in the html headers
        and able to be retrieved via HEAD nerd.amorris.ca
      - a published matter should have preview info in HEAD,
        including links+descriptions that the feed will show,
        along with a link to the page to see more details.
