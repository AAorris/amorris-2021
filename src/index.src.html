		<h3>What are you up to?</h3>
		<p class="tj">Right now I'm slimming down my web site
			and experimenting with regularly sharing interesting links
			in the news section above.</p>

		<h3>How does this site work?</h3>
		<p class="tj">This is a static site. It's generated from a flat file database.
			C code parses the text files and populates a sqlite db.
			Bash scripts query the db and output html.
			When I git push, <a href="http://zeit.co/now">Now</a> compiles my c tools and publishes the site with them.</p>
		<h3>Why did you do that?!</h3>
		<p class="tj">The footprint of the internet on the earth is growing.
			We should use the simplest, lightest, and most long term
				tools that we control to tell our stories.
			The way you deliver a story is as important as the content,
				and part of my story is taking the path less travelled.</p>
