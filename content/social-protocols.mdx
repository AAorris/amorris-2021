# Social Protocols

How do we connect with each other?

---

# Feeds

Facebook, Instagram, Twitter

Public subscription to ranked content in your network.

---

# Messaging

Messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram

Real-time, private, able to go offline without losing messages.

---

# Identity

Email, OAuth, DNS

Find people via search, URL, recommendations, matchmaking.

Ideally we could transfer links to our identity to new ones.

---

# Personal Information

We should be able to store our personal information wherever we want.

All data should be able to be stored in static files, and private data only decipherable to who we allow to see.

# Goals

I can connect easily with others

I can produce content that is visible to others

I can produce content that is visible only to me or those I choose

I can browse a digest of content that is important to me

I can communicate in real time with my connections around the world

I can choose any platform I want to connect with my network

I can move to other platforms without losing my network

I can own and store my own personal information

# Thoughts

Instead of exchanging phone numbers, we exchange web urls (ex. amorris.ca) and can connect on any platform from there.

We have the ability to connect with people we encounter (on bus, in park, at work, concert, etc)
in a way that is safe and non-compromising (ex. we are only visible to others under X conditions, or not at all)

We can redirect our web site to a new location and our network will update its records accordingly

---

# Conclusion

Web sites become universal identities in our address books

We have programmable user agents on our devices that can socialize with others over a peer-to-peer protocol or via hubs

We can build or use any platform for socializing with our networks

We are the owners of our own networks and personal data
