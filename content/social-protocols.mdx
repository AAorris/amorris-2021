Can I meet new people in a safe way?

Can I keep my network without losing my friends?

Can I connect with a person, and not just their platform?

I'm Alice.

I meet Bob on the bus. He's a blogger.

We exchange IDs - `alice.me` and `bob.passport.net`.

---

When Bob accepts my friend request, he puts blog access into our connection.

I can log in to bobsblog.com using alice.me without signing up.

---

Bob's blog supports web hooks, and I point one at alice.me

When Bob posts, it goes into my inbox.

My personal feed is ranked using open source software.

---

After viewing Bob's blog for a while, I want to chat.

I send a request to include messaging in our connection.

I can access our conversation through my personal web dashboard.

When I open our chat, our servers communicate in real time.

---

Bob moves his ID to `bob.me`.

Before he removes bob.passport.net, he redirects it to `bob.passport.net`.

When I open my dashboard, I receive an alert to update our friendship ID.

When he moves his blog, my dashboard updates automatically.
