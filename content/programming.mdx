# Programming

My opinion: programming is about encoding goals using language.

---

## Goals

All programs have a goal. How do we reach them?

Right now, we achieve goals by following explicit human instructions.

This relies on human understanding of how to achieve certain goals.

In the future, we may provide data, and their relationships instead.

### Next steps with goals

We are making great progress with machine learning.  

We can provide data instead of code.  

We can let the machine learning process fill in the blanks.  

As goals get more complex, we may find accurate data better than code.  

As complex goals change, we may retrain on new data faster than reimplementing.

## Language

Language is made up of syntax and semantics.

Syntax is the structure of a language. What makes text valid or invalid for a language?

Semantics is the meaning of a language. What does text mean? How will it change the system?

---

## Systems

Languages run on a system with certain capabilities.

- Defining and manipulating data
- Interacting with system devices
- Communicating with other programs

---

### You are a system

You can define and store information in your brain  

You are made up of devices like hands, legs, eyes, mouth  

You can communicate with your body, and with other sentience  

We have goals. We drive ourselves and communicate with others to accomplish them.  

We're inspiring because of how many different goals we can accomplish.

# Takeaways

How powerful is programming if it can represent ourselves?  

How can we progress in defining more impactful goals, expressive and intuitive language, and more capable systems?
